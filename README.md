Project: Behavioural Cloning of  Autonomous Car

Here NVIDIA model is implemented and trained to predict the steering angle of each and every frame of a car on simulated track.

UDACITY car simulator is used to train and validate the model on its default tracks. The Flask-Socketio application(patch file) is used to establish the server-client communication between the model and simulator.

Patch file can be found in 'https://github.com/BodduRaviteja/BehaviouralCloningPatchfile.git'
